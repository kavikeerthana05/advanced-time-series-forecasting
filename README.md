# Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Attention

## Overview
This project implements and compares two deep learning models for multistep
time-series forecasting:

1. LSTM Baseline Model  
2. Attention-based Seq2Seq Model (LSTM + Self-Attention)

The goal is to evaluate how attention mechanisms improve long-term dependency
modeling compared to a standard LSTM baseline.
